# **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework using Cross-Attention**

## **Overview**
The **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework** is a state-of-the-art solution that integrates multiple specialized smaller language models (SLMs) to deliver domain-specific expertise through collaborative reasoning. This system surpasses traditional monolithic large-scale language models (LLMs) by employing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), intelligent query routing, and cross-attention mechanisms. It achieves superior computational efficiency while delivering semantically rich, precise, and robust responses across diverse domains.

This project aims to develop an efficient, domain-aware chatbot system by integrating specialized models like **BioGPT** (for medical expertise) and **Qwen Coder** (for technical expertise) into a collaborative framework. The system utilizes **GPT-4.0 Mini** as a lightweight query analysis and routing agent to decompose user queries and direct them to relevant models. Leveraging **cross-attention** and **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**, the architecture ensures knowledge exchange and optimized collaboration between models.

   Cross Attention Logic
</p>

Cross attention is a pivotal mechanism in our framework that enables collaborative reasoning and information exchange between specialized language models (SLMs), such as **BioGPT** and **Qwen Coder**, to produce unified, semantically coherent responses. It operates as the connective tissue between models, aligning their domain-specific insights and ensuring that the final output leverages the strengths of each model effectively.

#### **How Cross Attention Works**
1. **Input Tensors from Specialized Models**:
   - Each domain-specific model (e.g., **BioGPT** and **Qwen Coder**) processes its assigned query fragments and generates two key components:
     - **Key (K)**: Encodes the contextual information of the domain.
     - **Value (V)**: Represents the actual knowledge or output of the model.
     - Additionally, for cross-attention, a **Query (Q)** tensor is generated from the main routing model (**GPT-4.0 Mini**) or the primary domain.

2. **Attention Scores Calculation**:
   - Cross attention calculates the **similarity between the Query tensor (Q)** from one model and the **Key tensor (K)** from another model:
     <br />
     ### *Attention Scores = Q . K ^ T*
     <br />
   - This step identifies how strongly one model's output (Value tensor) should influence the response, based on its relevance to the query.

3. **Weighting the Outputs**:
   - The attention scores are passed through a **softmax function** to normalize them into probabilities.
   - These probabilities are then applied to the Value tensor (V) of the second model:
     <br />
     ### *Context=Softmax(Attention Scores)⋅V*
     <br />
   - This creates a refined "context" that integrates knowledge from the second model into the primary response.

4. **Knowledge Exchange**:
   - The refined context vectors are **reshaped and combined** into the originating model's tensor, enabling a bidirectional exchange of knowledge.
   - This ensures that models do not work in isolation but instead collaboratively enrich each other’s outputs.

5. **Unified Response Generation**:
   - After cross-attention, the enriched outputs from all participating models are merged, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the query.

### **Benefits of Cross Attention in Our Framework**
1. **Semantic Alignment**:
   - Cross attention ensures that responses from different models are aligned and consistent in context, even if they originate from diverse domains.

2. **Enhanced Collaboration**:
   - It allows models to "learn from" and adapt to the strengths of other models during query resolution, resulting in a holistic response.

3. **Contextual Refinement**:
   - By weighting the contributions of each model's output, cross attention dynamically adjusts the importance of specific knowledge based on query relevance.

4. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Instead of using a single, large-scale model for all queries, cross attention leverages lightweight specialized models and fuses their outputs effectively.

### **Example Workflow: Query Splitting and Cross Attention**
- **Original Query**: "Explain how diabetes impacts cardiovascular health and suggest a technical solution to monitor related risks."
  1. **Query Splitting**:
     - Sub-Query 1: "How does diabetes impact cardiovascular health?" → Sent to **BioGPT**.
     - Sub-Query 2: "What are technical solutions to monitor cardiovascular risks for diabetes patients?" → Sent to **Qwen Coder**.
  2. **Domain-Specific Processing**:
     - **BioGPT**: Outputs a detailed explanation of the biological link between diabetes and cardiovascular health.
     - **Qwen Coder**: Suggests technical solutions like wearable devices or monitoring applications.
  3. **Cross Attention Integration**:
     - Cross attention enables knowledge sharing between the models, enriching the technical solution with medical context and vice versa.
  4. **Unified Response**:
     - A final, coherent answer is generated, combining medical insights with actionable technical recommendations.
