# **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework using Cross-Attention**

## **Overview**
The **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework** is a predicted state-of-the-art solution , that uses multiple Specialized Smaller language models (SLMs) to deliver domain-specific colab that surpass traditional monolithic large-scale language models (LLMs). By employing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, intelligent query routing and some other advanced learning Techniques , this system achieves superior computational efficiency and delivers contextually precise, efficient, and robust responses.

## **Key Features**
1. **Intelligent Query Splitting and Routing**:
   - Uses a State of the art (SOTA) LLM API to divide user queries into domain-specific components.
   - Model Specialization: Routes components to domain-specific models:
     - Technical Queries: Addressed by Qwen Coder.
     - Medical Queries: Addressed by BioGPT.

2. **Model Collaboration via Cross-Attention**:
   - Uses **cross-attention mechanism** to integrate domain-specific insights into a unified response.
   - Ensures comprehensive understanding across disciplines.

3. **Reinforcement Learning & Caching** (Not Yet Implemented):
   - Employs RL for model collaboration and response refinement.
   - Implements **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** with game-theory principles to foster synergistic behavior.
   - Leverages embeddings from SentenceTransformer and indexes in Pinecone for query optimization and caching.

---

## **System Architecture**
1. **Input Handling**:
   - User queries are preprocessed and analyzed using embeddings.
   - Pinecone checks for cached responses to reduce computation for frequent queries.
2. **Domain-Specific Processing**:
   - Query is intelligently split and routed by GPT-4-mini.
   - BioGPT and Qwen Coder process their respective query fragments and generate initial responses.
3. **Cross-Domain Integration and Output**:
   - Responses are integrated through cross-attention mechanisms to exchange insights and refine outputs.
   - GPT-4-mini combines the refined outputs into a cohesive and contextually accurate answer..
