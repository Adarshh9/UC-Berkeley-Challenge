# Meta-Learning-Driven Multi-Expert System for Domain-Specific Question Answering

## Project Overview
This project develops an advanced meta-learning-based multi-expert system for precise and context-aware question answering across specialized domains. By integrating multiple expert models fine-tuned for specific domains, the system provides intelligent and contextually relevant responses.

## Key Features
- Dynamic Query Routing
- Cross-Attention Meta-Learning Integration
- Confidence and Uncertainty Metrics
- Domain-Specific Knowledge Embedding

## System Architecture
The system employs a sophisticated workflow:
- Intelligent gatekeeping mechanism for query routing
- Meta-learning framework with cross-attention
- Domain-specific expert model integration
- Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv
