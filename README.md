# **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework using Cross-Attention**

## **Overview**
The **Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Framework** is a predicted state-of-the-art solution , that uses multiple Specialized Smaller language models (SLMs) to deliver domain-specific colab that surpass traditional monolithic large-scale language models (LLMs). By employing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, intelligent query routing and some other advanced learning Techniques , this system achieves superior computational efficiency and delivers contextually precise, efficient, and robust responses.

## **Key Features**
1. **Intelligent Query Splitting and Routing**:
   - Uses a State of the art (SOTA) LLM API to divide user queries into domain-specific components.
   - Model Specialization: Routes components to domain-specific models:
     - Technical Queries: Addressed by Qwen Coder.
     - Medical Queries: Addressed by BioGPT.

2. **Model Collaboration via Cross-Attention**:
   - Uses **cross-attention mechanism** to integrate domain-specific insights into a unified response.
   - Ensures comprehensive understanding across disciplines.

3. **Reinforcement Learning & Caching** (Not Yet Implemented):
   - Employs RL for model collaboration and response refinement.
   - Implements **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** with game-theory principles to foster synergistic behavior.
   - Leverages embeddings from SentenceTransformer and indexes in Pinecone for query optimization and caching.

## **System Architecture**
Input Query Analysis:
- User queries are analyzed and routed by GPT-4.0 Mini.
- Pre-generated responses are retrieved from a Redis-based cache if available.

Domain-Specific Processing:
- Query components are routed to domain-specific models (BioGPT, Qwen Coder), which generate independent responses and embeddings.

Cross-Attention Mechanism:
- Responses are refined through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling collaborative reasoning.

Response Generation:
- Outputs are merged and validated by GPT-4.0 Mini, producing a unified, semantically rich response.

Reinforcement Learning:
- MARL principles iteratively optimize model collaboration for long-term performance.
